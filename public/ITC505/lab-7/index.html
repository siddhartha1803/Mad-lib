            <p>
                During the development of this Mad Lib assignment, I encountered several issues involving form
                submission, routing, and output formatting. The first challenge was handling the POST request properly;
                initially the values sent from the form were not being captured until I enabled body parsing using
                <code>express.urlencoded()</code>. This ensured that all form fields were available through
                <code>req.body</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next challenge involved route conflicts with static file serving. My server returned 404 errors
                because custom routes were defined before <code>express.static()</code>. Once I reordered the routes so
                that static files loaded first, the HTML and CSS began functioning properly.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also had to address empty form submissions. Without validation, incomplete inputs produced broken Mad
                Lib stories. I implemented simple backend checks to verify that each field contained a value before
                generating the final output.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, I improved the readability of the generated story by switching from basic string concatenation
                to template literals. This allowed the story to be structured clearly and formatted in a way that matched
                the intended narrative style.
